This is a document to explain what I would do next with this application.
I spent ages setting up Laravel and had very little time to learn much about it's features.
I will admit from what I have seen it is very easy to learn as I have worked with the 
Symfony framework and I hope to continue this project in the future.

My first priority would be to move my data to an MySQL database and extend it to allow
for reviews and user accounts. The setup would be a table for attractions, a table for 
reviews and a table for user accounts. The review table would contain foreign keys to 
the other two tables to have them linked. The user table would also store whether the 
account is an admin or not, given more time I would make it permission based.

Next would be to implement the login system. I noticed there are a few login classes already
in the project so I would work with those as an example/base.

Then I would build the review system to allow users that are logged in to submit reviews or
edit them. I would also start to rank the attractions on the homepage based on those 
reviews.

I would add more content to the site as it is very minimal with few styles, possibly 
even an image carousel on the homepage.

Finally I would go through my code for PSR standards and add PHPUnit tests. It has been a 
while since I had to do them manually as the IDE I normally work in has all of them set 
up already as a file watcher.
